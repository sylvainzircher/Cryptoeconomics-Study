# ✨ Cryptoeconomics-study
I am using this repository as a way to track my progress while going through the **amazing** [cryptoeconomics.study course](https://cryptoeconomics.study/en/). 

## What is this about?

### :books: Fun Fastpaced Lectures
> Our goal is to make it as easily as possible to understand the inner workings of protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum. We start by learning about how a simple payment processor like Paypal works and go all the way to understanding Bitcoin and (coming soon!) cutting-edge Ethereum research like Proof of Stake and Plasma. Through our fun, animated lectures, we’ll give you a high-level overview of all of the key concepts needed to understand Blockchain protocols.

### :bulb: Challenging Code Assignments
> Each lecture is accompanied by a challenging coding assignment, where you will implement the concepts from the lecture. By actually building the protocols and attacks from the lectures, you’ll learn all of the nitty-gritty technical details in a fun, hands-on way. After completing the coding assignments, you’ll have the knowledge to start contributing to research discussions and development of cryptoeconomic designs.
